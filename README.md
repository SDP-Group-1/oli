# OLI
Project board created under "Projects" tab. It's a kanban board, so it's convenient to organise. The tasks are automated: 
- When a new issue is opened, it is automatically added to the to do column. 
- When a pull request to merge is created, it is moved to in progress. You can open a pull request from your branch well in advance of merging if you want to move the item to the progress column. 
- When a pull request is merged, that item will be moved to the completed column.

When you make commits in your branch, be sure to add your issue number to the title of your commit (it automatically links it :))
